Welcome!

I am a data-driven Economist, with several years of experience using causal inference econometrics, economic modelling, time series, and machine learning tools to answer academic and business questions at world class organizations. I have been analyzed all kinds of very big data and have been involved in all the steps in that process: from building a server, to data gathering, warehousing and wrangling, to data analysis using R, Python, Stata, QGIS, and SQL.

My research interests include urban economics, economic growth, labor economics, health economics, and applied econometrics.

I hold a Ph.D in Economics from Brown University, a Master's Degree in Specialized Economic Analysis: Economics of Public Policy Program from Barcelona School of Economics, graduate studies in urban economics at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad de la República (Uruguay).
