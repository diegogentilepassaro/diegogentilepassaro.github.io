Welcome!

I am a data-driven Economist, with several years of experience using causal inference econometrics, economic modeling, time series, and machine learning tools to answer academic and business questions at world-class organizations. I have analyzed all kinds of very big data and have been involved in all the steps in that process: from building a server to data gathering, warehousing, and wrangling, to data analysis using R, Python, Stata, QGIS, and SQL.

My research interests include urban economics, economic growth, labor economics, health economics, and applied econometrics.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Brown University, a Master's Degree in Specialized Economic Analysis: Economics of Public Policy Program from Barcelona School of Economics, graduate studies in urban economics at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad de la Rep√∫blica (Uruguay).
